## Project Title

*Can Bombardier’s Operations Absorb Future Landing-Gear Demand?
A 3–5 Year Capacity Planning Analysis for the Challenger Fleet*

## Executive Summary

![Demand Projection of Bomardier vs. Direct Competitors](images/demand_projection.png)

- This project evaluates whether Bombardier can meet future landing-gear maintenance demand driven by an aging business-jet fleet, with emphasis on the Challenger family, which represents the largest share of active aircraft and the primary driver of maintenance volume.

- Fleet aging analysis indicates a meaningful rise in landing-gear maintenance demand, reaching approximately **10% growth by 2027** and accelerating toward **~30% by 2029**, driven by high-utilization, standardized maintenance requirements associated with Challenger aircraft.

- A comparative operational assessment shows that mature service centers are best suited to sustain baseline demand, while throughput-oriented facilities with available expansion headroom are better positioned to absorb incremental growth without disrupting service reliability.

- The analysis concludes that a phased capacity-expansion strategy—anchored by throughput-focused facilities for near-term growth and complemented by authorized partner MROs for medium-term scaling—offers the lowest-risk path to sustaining Bombardier’s aftermarket leadership through 2029. 


## Project Background 

As Bombardier’s installed fleet continues to age, aftermarket services—particularly landing-gear maintenance—have become a critical driver of long-term revenue, customer satisfaction, and operational resilience. Landing gear is a high-value, safety-critical system that requires recurring overhaul as aircraft progress through their service life. Understanding whether Bombardier’s current operational footprint can absorb future maintenance demand is therefore a strategic question with direct implications for capacity planning and service-network optimization.
This project was initiated to evaluate whether Bombardier has sufficient operational capacity to meet projected landing-gear maintenance demand over the next 3–5 years, and to identify where incremental capacity expansion would be most effective.

![Fleet Evaluation of Business-Jet Key Players](images/Fleet_Size&Fleet_age_insight.png)

The analysis focuses on:
- Business jets registered with the FAA +10M rows of data, with emphasis on Bombardier and its direct competitors.

- Landing-gear maintenance demand, using fleet size and aircraft age as primary demand drivers.

- The Challenger aircraft family, which represents the largest share of Bombardier’s active fleet and the dominant contributor to maintenance volume.

- North American service facilities, including OEM service centers, line stations, and authorized MRO partners

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:
- Quantify landing-gear maintenance demand based on fleet size and age distribution
- Compare Bombardier’s demand profile against direct competitors
- Assess Bombardier’s operational capacity to absorb near-term (~10% by 2027) and medium-term (~30% by 2029) demand growth
- Identify the most effective facilities to serve as incremental capacity levers
- Provide actionable, risk-aware recommendations to support executive decision-making


### Methodology and Key Steps

To achieve these objectives, the analysis followed a structured approach:

1. Fleet Analysis
 - Extracted and cleaned FAA aircraft registry data
 - Normalized manufacturer and model information
 - Calculated fleet size and age distribution by OEM and aircraft family

2. Demand Modelling
 - Translated fleet age buckets into a landing-gear demand index
 - Identified Challenger-family aircraft as the primary demand driver

3. Operational Assessment
 - Categorized Bombardier’s service network by capability and role
 - Evaluated facilities based on scalability, utilization, and work characteristics

4.  Scenario Planning & Risk Assessment
 - Modelled demand growth scenarios through 2029
 - Identified key operational risks and mitigation strategies


### Data Structure












### High In-Demand Jet Models 

**Challenger Family Landing-Gear Maintenance Demand**

The Challenger family aircraft drives landing-gear maintenance demand due to the following characteristics: 

- Large installed base relative to other Bombardier programs
- Aging fleet profile, with a high proportion of aircraft beyond 11 years of service
- High utilization rates, particularly in corporate and character operations
- Recurring and predictable maintenance cycles, especially for the landing year
- Standarized overhaul work scopes, with limited customization across aircraft

Operation Implications and Facility Fit

Given this demand profile, Challenger landing-gear maintenance is best supported by facilities optimized for high-throughput operations rather than engineering work. Facilities with repeatable, line-based processes, scalable staffing and shift structures, and strong logistics connectivity are well-suited to absorb this type of demand efficiently. Aligning Challenger landing-gear workloads with such throughput-oriented operational environments enables Bombardier to scale capacity in a controlled manner, maintain turnaround times, and manage costs effectively as maintenance demand continues to grow over the next several years.

### Bombardier Manufacturing Units 

To assess Bombardier's ability to absorb approximately 10% incremental landing-gear maintenance demand for the Challenger family by 2027, we evaluated seven North American service locations with relevant maintenance capability. Each facility was assessed based on its technical capability, current operational role, scalability, and suitability for high-volume, standarized landing-gear work. This analysis focuses not on where landing-gear is currently performed, but on identifying the most efficient and lowest-risk level for incremental capacity expansion within Bombardier's service network. 

Here's the summary analysis on how and why each service center in North America can be or can not be the best choice to cover 10% demand growth by 2027:




| Service Station | Role | Facility Features | Station Evaluation for Growth | Analysis |
|-----------------|------|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| Dallas Service Center | Core baseline heavy maintenance hub | One of Bombardier’s most mature OEM service centers with deep airframe and landing-gear capability and a highly experienced engineering and technician workforce. | Likely already optimized for baseline demand. Mature centers typically operate at steady-state utilization, and rapid expansion risks congestion and service interruption. | Dallas should remain focused on baseline demand stability rather than absorbing incremental Challenger landing-gear growth. |
| Miami Opa-Locka Service Center | Regional demand hub (Latin America / Southeast US) | Strategic geographic coverage with growing regional fleet demand and capability to perform heavy maintenance tasks. | Regional demand variability limits suitability for standardized, volume-driven throughput. Better positioned for geographically driven demand rather than global overflow. | Miami Opa-Locka is best utilized for region-specific demand rather than network-wide Challenger throughput expansion. |
| Hartford Service Center | Specialized service center | Supports specific customer requirements and contributes to overall network resilience. | Smaller operational scale compared to other service centers reduces suitability for high-volume expansion. | Hartford plays a supporting role but lacks the scale required to absorb material Challenger demand growth. |
| Wichita Service Center | Mature aviation MRO hub | Strong aviation workforce ecosystem with established airframe maintenance capability. | Capacity constraints and limited logistical advantage reduce suitability for global Challenger throughput expansion. | Wichita should be maintained as a stable, mature operation rather than targeted for aggressive growth initiatives. |
| Tucson Service Center | Regional / fleet-specific support | Provides geographic diversification and supports specific customer bases rather than general network throughput. | Smaller scale and limited logistical advantage restrict expansion for standardized, high-volume landing-gear work. | The Tucson Center complements the network but is not optimized for absorbing large volumes of standardized landing-gear workload. |
| Toronto–Pearson (Skyservice) | Primary growth lever | Newer facility designed with modern throughput concepts, located in a major logistics and labor hub, with flexibility to add shifts, parallel lines, and modular capacity at lower disruption risk. | Highly suitable for rapid capacity expansion with minimal operational disruption. | Toronto–Pearson is well-positioned to absorb approximately 10% incremental Challenger landing-gear demand growth. |
| Duncan Aviation (BTL) – Authorized Service Facility | Scalable external partner capacity | Highly capable Authorized Service Facility with strong Challenger experience, suitable for overflow support and long-term scaling. | Expansion requires coordination with partner and provides less direct operational control compared to OEM facilities. | Duncan Aviation represents a viable secondary option to support demand growth through a partner-based expansion model. |

## Key Risks & Mitigation Methods


| Key Risk Area | Risk Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Workforce Availability Risk | The aviation MRO industry faces a sustained shortage of certified maintenance technicians. Rapid capacity expansion at mature service centers may be constrained by hiring lead times, training requirements, and labor competition. | Prioritize expansion at facilities with existing workforce headroom and throughput-oriented operations. Phase capacity increases through additional shifts and process optimization before headcount-heavy expansion. |
| Over-Concentration at Mature Service Centers | Routing incremental Challenger landing-gear demand to mature OEM service centers (e.g., Dallas, Wichita) risks congestion, longer turnaround times, and service-quality degradation. | Maintain mature service centers as baseline demand anchors. Redirect incremental growth to designated growth-lever facilities. Monitor utilization thresholds and dynamically rebalance workloads across the network. |
| Execution Risk During Rapid Scale-Up | Accelerated capacity expansion may introduce operational inefficiencies, quality risks, or disruption to existing maintenance operations. | Implement phased ramp-up plans (e.g., pilot programs and parallel operations). Use operational KPIs to govern and control scale-up execution. |
| Demand Forecast Uncertainty | Actual landing-gear demand growth may deviate from projections due to utilization changes, fleet retirement rates, or economic cycles impacting business aviation. | Design capacity expansion to be modular and reversible using flexible shifts, external partners, and temporary staffing models. |
| Dependency on External MRO Partners | Heavy reliance on Authorized Service Facilities introduces risks related to quality consistency and scheduling alignment. | Maintain a balanced mix of internal OEM capacity and external MRO partners. Prioritize partners with proven Challenger maintenance experience. |
	

**Executive Takeaway**

By sequencing capacity expansion across internal growth-oriented facilities and certified partners, Bombardier can mitigate workforce, execution, and demand-uncertainty risks while maintaining service reliability through 2029. 



## Recommendations

Bombardier should prioritize a phased expansion of landing-gear maintenance capacity for the Challenger family by leveraging throughput-oriented facilities with available expansion headroom - led by the Toronto-Pearson Service Center - While sustaining baseline demand at mature OEM centers and scaling capacity further through authorized MRO partners to meet medium-term growth. 

**Actionable Plan**

**Near Term (2025 - 2027) | 10% demand increase)**

- *Use Toronto-Pearson as the primary growth lever*
	- Add shifts and parallel work lines
	- Focus on high-volume, standarized Challenger landing-gear work

- *Keep Dallas, Wichita, and Miami focused on:* 
	- Baseline heavy industry
	- Service continuity and reliability

**Medium Term (2027 - 2029 | up to +30 - 32% demand increase)**

- Expand use of Authorized Service Facilities (e.g. Duncan Aviation) for Challenger programs

- Use OEM service centers for complex cases and global-family landing-gear work

- Avoid overloading mature centers that are already optimized for steady demand


## Final Recommendation 

Based on the projected growth in Challenger landing-gear maintenance demand, Bombardier should adopt a phased-capacity expansion strategy. In the near term, incremental demand of approximately 10% by 2027 should be absorbed through throughput-oriented facilities with available headroom, led by Toronto-Pearson Service Center. Mature OEM service centers such as Dallas, Wichita, and Miami should continue to anchor baseline heavy maintenance demand. Beyond 2027, sustaining up to 30-32% demand growth will require broader utilization of authorized MRO partners, allowing Bombardier to scale capacity while preserving operational resilience and service quality.
